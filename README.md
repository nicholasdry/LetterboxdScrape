This project is to provide simple scraping features for data collection on user profiles on http://www.letterboxd.com.

This is to hold me over until the API is released to the public.

I want to implement more than just the watchlist scraping which I have running.

Watchlist:
	-Multithreads into odd and even page threads for quicker scraping

All data comes from http://www.letterboxd.com and is owned by them.
